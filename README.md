# Test task for Syberry
The purpose of the task is to implement an interface that will order a list of tasks according to the information about their dependencies. For example, if task A has a dependency on tasks B and C, this means that to start working on task A tasks B and C have to be completed first.

The interface shall take a list of tasks (defined in any order) as the input parameter and output a list of tasks sorted in the order they may be executed.
